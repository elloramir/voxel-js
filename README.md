I made this just to pass the time while I'm in a meeting ðŸ˜›. This "game" does not use any external libraries (except for the Simplex Noise generator and the glMatrix lib for math) and was made in nearly one day. There is a lot of room for improvement, which Iâ€™ll list here. Maybe in the future, I'll return to it and work on some of the tasks below.

### To be done
- [x] basic framework core
- [x] free view camera
- [x] generate chunks
- [x] world of chunks
- [x] optimize chunk borders
- [x] frustum culling and frustum chunk generation
- [x] ambient occlusion
- [x] view fog
- [ ] better world generation
- [ ] water shader
